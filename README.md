# Typescript - Mocha - Chai Boilerplate

> Boilerplate for typescript with testing using mocha and chai (this is not intended to be used in production)

## Prerequisites

```
npm install -g mocha istanbul
npm install
```

## Build

```
npm install -g typescript
# and build using VScode
```

## Testing

```
source env
test <dir>
cover <dir>
```

If you cannot `source` just go see the `env` file itself you will have a start.
